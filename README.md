# React Based Portfolio Page

WIP - Will be my personal portfolio page

## TODOS

* Finish design and full layout
* Finish all pages
* Nav bar based styles -> Expanded and Hidden
* Content height -> Play around with lowering it to center it better. I don't like how close to the top it all is
* Add Media Queries for a good experience on multiple screen sizes/
* Clean up code: Condense CSS files (Specifically between education and work), condense images into global folder to prevent duplicates, etc.
